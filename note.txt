How do I find my USB port name in Linux?

To do this, open a Terminal window, type ls /dev/ttyUSB* , and press enter. 

=====

As you've noticed, ( ls -l /dev/ttyUSB* )
the /dev/ttyUSB0 device has the group of dialout. 
All you need to do is add the current user to the dialout group:

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

thou will need to log out & log back in again for this to take effect.

=====

to list which version of python environment thou can create :

conda search "^python$"

=====

install python-vlc in Anaconda

pip install python-vlc

NOTE : not using conda
